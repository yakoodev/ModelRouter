# Tasks Workflow

- `tasks/todo` - approved backlog, ready to start.
- `tasks/inprogress` - tasks currently being implemented.
- `tasks/done` - completed tasks with merged result.

Each task file should include:
- goal and scope,
- explicit acceptance criteria,
- links to related PRs/tests/docs after completion.
